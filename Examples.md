### Basics of Bash Scripting

Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is one of the most common shell environments on Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS). Bash scripts are used to automate tasks, manipulate files, and interact with system processes.

Here's an introduction to **Bash scripting** basics.

---

### 1. **Creating a Bash Script**

To create a Bash script:
1. Open a text editor (e.g., `nano`, `vim`, `emacs`).
2. Write your script.
3. Save it with a `.sh` extension (though it's optional, it’s good practice).

Example: `myscript.sh`

Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x myscript.sh
```

To run the script:
```bash
./myscript.sh
```

---

### 2. **Shebang (`#!`)**
The first line in a Bash script usually starts with `#!`, followed by the path to the shell (i.e., the "shebang"). It tells the system which interpreter to use to execute the script.

For Bash scripts:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

This line is not mandatory, but it ensures that the script will always run using Bash, regardless of the environment.

---

### 3. **Basic Script Example**

Here's a basic Bash script that prints "Hello, World!" and takes user input:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# A simple Bash script

echo "Hello, World!"   # Print a message to the terminal

# Ask for user input
echo "What is your name?"
read name
echo "Hello, $name!"
```

In this script:
- `echo` is used to print text to the screen.
- `read` takes input from the user and stores it in a variable (`$name`).
- `$name` is used to reference the value of the variable.

---

### 4. **Variables**

Variables in Bash are created by simply assigning a value. **No spaces around the equal sign**.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
name="Alice"  # Define a variable
echo "Hello, $name!"  # Use the variable
```

- `$name` is used to access the value of the variable.
- You can also use `echo $name` or `echo ${name}` to display it.

---

### 5. **Control Flow**

#### a) **If/Else Statements**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

x=10
if [ $x -gt 5 ]; then  # -gt is "greater than" in Bash
  echo "x is greater than 5"
else
  echo "x is less than or equal to 5"
fi
```

Common comparison operators:
- `-eq` → equal to
- `-ne` → not equal to
- `-gt` → greater than
- `-lt` → less than
- `-ge` → greater than or equal to
- `-le` → less than or equal to

#### b) **Loops**

**For Loop**: Iterate over a sequence of items or numbers.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

for i in {1..5}; do  # Loop through numbers 1 to 5
  echo "Number $i"
done
```

**While Loop**: Keep running as long as the condition is true.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

count=1
while [ $count -le 5 ]; do
  echo "Count is $count"
  ((count++))  # Increment the counter
done
```

---

### 6. **Functions**

You can define functions to reuse blocks of code.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define a function
greet() {
  echo "Hello, $1!"  # $1 is the first argument passed to the function
}

greet "Alice"  # Call the function with "Alice" as the argument
greet "Bob"    # Call the function with "Bob"
```

In the above:
- `greet` is a function.
- `$1`, `$2`, etc., are arguments passed to the function.

---

### 7. **Input and Output**

#### a) **Input**

Use `read` to take user input.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter your favorite color:"
read color
echo "Your favorite color is $color"
```

#### b) **Output**

Use `echo` to print to the screen, or redirect output to a file.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "This is a test" > output.txt  # Redirect output to a file
echo "This is another line" >> output.txt  # Append to the file
```

#### c) **Command Substitution**

You can use the output of a command inside your script.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

current_date=$(date)  # Get the current date
echo "Today is: $current_date"
```

---

### 8. **Error Handling**

Bash scripts can handle errors using return codes and `if` conditions.

- Commands return an exit status (`0` is success, non-zero is failure).
- `&&` runs the second command only if the first one is successful.
- `||` runs the second command only if the first one fails.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

mkdir myfolder && echo "Folder created" || echo "Failed to create folder"
```

In this example, `mkdir myfolder` will create a directory, and depending on its success, the appropriate message will be printed.

---

### 9. **Arrays**

Bash supports indexed arrays.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Declare an array
fruits=("Apple" "Banana" "Cherry")

# Access elements
echo "First fruit: ${fruits[0]}"  # Apple
echo "All fruits: ${fruits[@]}"   # Apple Banana Cherry

# Iterate over the array
for fruit in "${fruits[@]}"; do
  echo "Fruit: $fruit"
done
```

---

### 10. **File Operations**

Bash can be used to interact with files and directories, such as checking if a file exists or moving files.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if a file exists
if [ -f "myfile.txt" ]; then
  echo "File exists"
else
  echo "File does not exist"
fi

# Create a new directory
mkdir new_directory

# Copy a file
cp myfile.txt new_directory/

# Move a file
mv myfile.txt new_directory/
```

---

### 11. **Comments**

Comments in Bash are denoted by the `#` symbol.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# This is a comment, and it will be ignored by the script
echo "Hello World!"  # This prints "Hello World!"
```

---

### 12. **Debugging a Bash Script**

You can debug your Bash script by using the `-x` flag when running it, or by adding `set -x` at the start of the script.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -x  # Enable debugging

echo "Debugging is on"
```
